This compiler is based on the following idea: if in your text there is some
\mathrm, it is obvious that you are in a $...$ section or in a \[...\] section.
So, if you want to abbreviate your typing, you could write instead:

		\[\rm{Roman\,math}\] and \bf{textual}

Then you must compile the current file with jb2tex 

		jb2tex file

that will output a file.tex
